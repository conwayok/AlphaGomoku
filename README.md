# AlphaGomoku

AlphaGomoku is a Gomoku AI based on [Alpha Zero's algorithm](https://deepmind.com/blog/alphago-zero-learning-scratch/).

This project requires [Keras](https://keras.io/) installed. 

# How to run
After cloning the project, training can be started by running **model_training/agc_training.py**. 
Testing of trained models can be done in **playground.py**.

Please note that the training may take while, because it requires at least a 4000+ games to achieve reasonable results. It is also recommended to train on a GPU.
